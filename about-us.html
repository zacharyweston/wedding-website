          Our Story
Like all great love stories, ours begins when we met at summer camp. Maybe if we had been less awkward and better at flirting, things could have gotten started back then.

(photos from camp)

After high school, Cassandra went to Spring Arbor University and Zak to Cedarville University. We stayed in touch, but didn’t reconnect until after college when Zak moved to Lansing for work. We both missed the communities we had experienced at college, so Zak invited Cassandra to The Dinner Club, a weekly gathering of friends who cook together and play games.

Eight months later, Zak asked Cassandra out on a date. It was just a walk in a small park, but it led to more conversations and more dates. This park was in the neighborhood where Cassandra's grandparents built their first house, where her dad used to play growing up and on the street where Zak lived when he moved to Lansing. In the park, there is a monument engraved with Zak’s grandpa’s and Cassandra’s mom’s favorite poem. And after two years of dating, Zak took Cassandra back to that monument, got down on one knee and proposed that we continue working and living and adventuring through life together.

We are both incredibly grateful to God, our families, our friends and all those who have shaped us into the people we are today. As much as we are celebrating our love at this time, we are equally celebrating all of you. Life is full of joys to be shared in community, challenges to be faced together with courage and work to be done to help those in the world who have need. We look forward to the future with joy and hopeful determination, incredibly thankful to be living life together, with all of you.

Trees by Joyce Kilmer
I think that I shall never see,
A poem lovely as a tree,
A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.
